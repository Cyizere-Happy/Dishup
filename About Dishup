Role: Frontend Developer (React)

Stack:

React ⚛️ | CSS 🎨 | REST APIs 🌐 | React Router 🚦 | Axios 📡

 
Dishup is a sleek and responsive food ordering app designed to connect users with nearby restaurants and enable fast, real-time deliveries. As the lead frontend developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the full user interface using React, with a focus on performance, usability, and scalability.

I built modular and reusable components that handle key user flows—including menu browsing, cart management, order placement, and real-time order tracking. I also integrated RESTful APIs using Axios for dynamic data fetching and ensured robust state management to maintain app consistency across views.

🔧 Key Frontend Contributions:
⚡ Developed scalable and maintainable React components using hooks and functional programming principles

🧭 Implemented client-side routing with React Router for smooth navigation across pages

💬 Integrated real-time user feedback features (loading states, success alerts, error handling)

🌐 Consumed and displayed data from RESTful APIs, optimizing UI responsiveness and performance

🎯 Worked closely with backend developers to ensure seamless end-to-end functionality and data flow

📱 Ensured full mobile responsiveness using modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid)

Dishup not only strengthened my core React development skills but also gave me hands-on experience in building a production-ready, user-focused web application. The project reflects my ability to create clean, efficient, and engaging frontend solutions that integrate smoothly with backend services—essential qualities in any modern web development environment.
